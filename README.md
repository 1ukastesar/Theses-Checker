**Abstract:** </br>
The main goal of this work is to create an application that checks technical reports and
marks all the found errors with PDF annotations. The technical documentation of this thesis
breaks down the structure of a PDF file, commonly found mistakes in graduate theses, web
development using the Django framework and discusses existing libraries for editing PDF
documents. The resulting application is implemented in Python and is accessible as a web
tool with the help of the Django framework. The developed solution recognizes six mostly
typographical errors frequently found in graduate theses. The mistakes found are visually
marked and the edited PDF file is then displayed directly on the web page. The resulting
tool is freely available and helps students and supervisors to correct the technical reports
the students create.
